<b>Chest X-Ray Images</b>

Detection of binary class from the Chest X-rays dataset using Convolutional Neural Network built from scratch and pre-trained models (EfficientNetB5).

<b>Context</b><br>
The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation, in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows), whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.
